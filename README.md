# Spotify Playlist Finder

## Find all of your playlists which contain a specific song

It's surprising that Spotify does not offer this functionality on its own. As of 2021, you can only search within your library, i.e. your saved songs, within a specific playlist, and of course globally as well. A search within all of your saved playlists has been posted as a [feature request](https://community.spotify.com/t5/live-ideas/your-library-search-within-all-playlists/idi-p/1558149), but has not been implemented yet. This feature is useful, for example to find possible duplicates.

This is why I created this little search tool. It is open source and uses the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/).

When you want to clone this repository, make sure to rename the file `env-sample` to `.env` and to add the credentials of your Spotify App.
