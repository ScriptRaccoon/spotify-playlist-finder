    It's surprising that Spotify does not offer this functionality on its own.
    As of 2021, you can only search within your library, i.e. your saved songs,
    within a specific playlist, and of course globally as well.
    A search within all of your saved playlists has been posted as a
    <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Your-Library-Search-within-all-Playlists/idi-p/1558149">feature request</a>,
    but has not been implemented yet. This feature is useful, for example to find possible duplicates.

    This is why I created this little search tool. It is <a href="https://github.com/ScriptRaccoon/spotify-playlist-finder" target="_blank">open source</a> and uses the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/" target="_blank">Spotify Web API</a>.
